This is a YouTube clone using React JS, MUI library, and YouTube/RapidAPI
  
## Note that this project is built following a tutorial from @adrianhajdin
 
  -> The only difference in my version is that I used the latest version of YouTube/RapidAPI: with the new requests and params

  -> Youtube/RapidAPI link: https://rapidapi.com/ytdlfree/api/youtube-v3-alternative
 
  -> To insert your api private key create .env file and put the private key in it after that import it using process to the src/utils/fetchFromApi.js file 

  -> @adrianhajdin youtube tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watchv=FHTbsZEJspU&list=PL6QREj8te1P6wX9m5KnicnDVEucbOPsqR&index=8&ab_channel=JavaScriptMastery 

  -> Please if you want to follow the YouTube tutorial make sure to check the API documentation and run some tests to recognize any further updates

  -> I'm planning to add some new features to this project such as search history and more

Thanks, Enjoy ;)
